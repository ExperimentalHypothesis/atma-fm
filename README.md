# Online Radio 
Online radio station built on top of the Icecast server using Ices as the streaming client. It is a server-centric website bridging backend streaming Icecast server with frontend GUI. It is written in Python Flask with a little bit of vanilla Javascript.

Online radio is broadcasting live 24/7, streaming mostly ambient/experimental/electronic music. All audio files are located on a VPS server, the code for the website is on the same server. I uses NGINX as reverse proxy and UWSGI as a web server.
