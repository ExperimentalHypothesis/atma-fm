      this is a 100% hobby project but it takes quite a bit of time, effort and money to keep it up. <br>
      you should also consider supporting the artists via bandcamp, discogs, amazon or any other way.</p>

      atma.fm is an experimental radio project focusing on ambient & electroacoustic music, broadcasting bullshit-free
      audio stream from the magic city prague. the playlist is quite diverse and is probably
      best expressed with the soundwave-like word cloud on the main page.
      there are currently two separated channels set up for the stream.

      this is all a one-man show do-it-yourself kind of thing. i have built it from scratch on top of icecast
      linux server mostly using python. as i was collecting marginal styles of music from a very young age,
      the idea of building a web streamer came naturally as soon as i figured out how to type on a keyboard.
      the fact that i have been working on it alone does not mean it has to stay this way forever. in fact, on the
      contrary - i would like to involve more people and open it to the community.
      feel free to contact me, if you wanna get involved.
