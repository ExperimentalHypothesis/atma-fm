  <p align="justify">this is a personal audio streaming project focusing on non-mainstream non-commercial ambient related & electroacoustic music. it is not rigidly devoted to one particular substyle/subgenre as might other online radio channels be - dronezone on soma.fm, ambientartsound, etc. - i honestly believe that these guys are too good and there is no point to mimic them or try to compete with them. on the contrary, the spectrum of tunes that one can stumble upon here is fairly eclectic, broad & much more unpredictable. it is probably best expressed with the wave sound-like word cloud on the main page.</p>
  <p align="justify">having been collecting marginal styles of music from my very young age, the idea of building an online streamer came naturally as soon as i figured out how to type on a keyboard. all of this is essentially a do-it-yourself project written from scratch on top of icecast server using python, javascript, c/c++ & many other technologies that i had to absorb. i am mainly self-taught, with a little formal training and this site is surely not the best web ever, rather it is labeled as "under constant development", as i plan to add on features and upgrades as time goes by.</p>
  <p align="justify">all the tracks use a bit rate of 128 kbp and sample rate of 44100 hz, they are all encoded with the <a href="https://lame.sourceforge.io/about.php" target="_blank">lame encoder</a> which is a recommended tool by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogenaudio"  target="_blank"> hydrogen audio</a> for mp3 files. the plan for the future is to go higher up to the bitrate of 320 or possibly play purely lossless files without any compressions whatsoever. each track ran through an acoustic loudness normalization algorithm to fit the current broadcasting standards defined in the ebu's <a href="https://tech.ebu.ch/docs/r/r128-2014.pdf" target="_blank"> technical protocol.</a></p></div>
